# How to Auto Train YOLOv8 Model with Autodistill

Autodistill uses big, slower foundation models to train small, faster supervised models. Using `autodistill`, you can go from unlabeled images to inference on a custom model running at the edge with no human intervention in between.

![Autodistill Steps](https://media.roboflow.com/open-source/autodistill/steps.jpg)

As foundation models get better and better they will increasingly be able to augment or replace humans in the labeling process. We need tools for steering, utilizing, and comparing these models. Additionally, these foundation models are big, expensive, and often gated behind private APIs. For many production use-cases, we need models that can run cheaply and in realtime at the edge.

## Steps in this Tutorial

In this tutorial, we are going to cover:

- Before you start
- Image dataset preperation
- Autolabel dataset
- Train target model
- Evaluate target model
- Run video inference
- Upload dataset and model to Roboflow (comming soon)

## üî• Let's begin!

## ‚ö° Before you start

Let's make sure that we have access to GPU. We can use `nvidia-smi` command to do that. In case of any problems navigate to `Edit` -> `Notebook settings` -> `Hardware accelerator`, set it to `GPU`, and then click `Save`.
"""

!nvidia-smi

"""## üß™ Install autodistill

**NOTE:** Autodistill is an ecosystem for using big, slower foundation models to train small, faster supervised models. Each Base, as well as the Target model, has its own separate repository and pip package.
"""

!pip install -q \
autodistill \
autodistill-grounded-sam \
autodistill-yolov8 \
roboflow \
supervision==0.9.0

"""**NOTE:** To make it easier for us to manage datasets, images and models we create a `HOME` constant."""

from cycler import V
import tqdm
HOME = os.getcwd()
print(HOME)

"""## üñºÔ∏è Image dataset preperation

**NOTE:** To use Autodistill all you need to have is a folder of images that you want to automatically annotate, and use for target model training.
"""

!mkdir {HOME}/images

"""## Download Images

Below, we provide two methods of retrieving images for use with Autodistill:

1. Download a dataset with images from Roboflow, and;
2. Download a raw video and split it up into images.

For this guide, we will be using a raw video to train our model.

### Download Images from Roboflow

You can download datasets from Roboflow using the below lines of code. You can download datasets associated with your account, or any of the 200,000+ public datasets on [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/). To download a dataset from Roboflow, you will need a [free Roboflow account](https://app.roboflow.com).

You need to paste in a URL to a full model, like so:

```
https://universe.roboflow.com/mohamed-traore-2ekkp/taco-trash-annotations-in-context/model/16
```

To find a model URL, go to a dataset page on Universe (i.e. the [TACO dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/mohamed-traore-2ekkp/taco-trash-annotations-in-context/)), then click "Model" in the sidebar to view the latest model version. Copy the page URL, then paste it into the `download_dataset()` function below.

![Universe model link](https://media.roboflow.com/universe_deploy_tab.png)

Uncomment the lines of code below to use the Roboflow dataset upload.
"""

# import roboflow

# roboflow.login()

# dataset = roboflow.download_dataset(dataset_url="https://universe.roboflow.com/mohamed-traore-2ekkp/taco-trash-annotations-in-context/model/16", model_format="yolov8")

"""Once you have downloaded your dataset, move all of the images from the `train` set in your downloaded dataset into the `images/` directory we created earlier:"""

# %mv {HOME}/<dataset-name>/train/* {HOME}/images

"""Now we are ready to start using Autodistill!

### Download raw videos

**NOTE:** In this tutorial, we will start with a directory containing video files and I will show you how to turn it into a ready-to-use collection of images. If you are working with your images, you can skip this part.
"""

!mkdir {HOME}/videos
# %cd {HOME}/videos

# download zip file containing videos
!wget https://media.roboflow.com/milk.zip

# unzip videos
!unzip milk.zip

"""### Convert videos into images

**NOTE:** Now, let's convert videos into images. By default, the code below saves every `10th` frame from each video. You can change this by manipulating the value of the `FRAME_STRIDE` parameter.
